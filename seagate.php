                    <h2>The Beach</h2>
                    <p>The beach is located right off the condo and has some of the best sand along the Gulf Coast.  It's sugary white texture is perfect for building sand castles with the kids or digging your feet in for some relaxation time.  If you already had plenty of sun, our balcony offers a perfect view of the beach.  So, if you have children, you'll be able to watch them from above.  The beaches are raked almost every morning, so get there before hand if you want to collect some shells or find some buried treasure!  Fishing off the beach is allowed, as well, so head over to the nearest bait shop for the latest fishing report.  Adjacent to the beach is where you'll find the condo shower for washing off before heading in. Don't forget about the BEAUTIFUL sunsets.  Watch them from the beach or the balcony! </p>

Some of these include: <a href="http://www.gofriendlyfisherman.com/" target="_blank">Friendly Fisherman</a>, <a href="http://sculleysrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Sculley's</a>, <a href="http://thehutbarandgrill.com/" target="_blank">The Hut Tiki Bar and Grille</a>, <a href="http://www.waltzfishshak.com/" target="_blank">Waltz Fish Shak</a>, <a href="http://www.bubbagump.com/" target="_blank">Bubba Gump Shrimp Company</a>, <a href="http://www.delosaspizza.com/" target="_blank">DeLosa's Pizzeria and Resturant</a>, and Pirates Pub and Grub.<p/>

                    <h2>On Water</h2>
                    <p>If you came down to Florida to be on the water...well, you came to the right place!  Fishing, boating, and...swimming with the manatees are just a few of the things that the surrounding areas of Sea Gate offer.</p>
                    <p>Beachfront fishing is common in Florida.  Sand Perch, trout, red fish, rays, even 8-foot Tarpon can be caught from the beach.  Check in with your local bait & tackle shops to see what's biting, what to use, and where to go.  <a href="http://www.tampabayfishingpier.com/" target="_blank">Redington Fishing Pier</a> is another great place to try your luck at fishing.  This fishing pier is about two miles south of Sea Gate and requires admission.  Across from the fishing pier is the <a href="https://www.dogfishtacklecompany.com/" target="_blank">Dogfish Tackle Company</a>, one of the largest bait and tackle stores along the beach.</p>
                    <p>Once per year(usually in June-July) sea turtles come out of the water and onto the beaches to lay their eggs.  If you keep a look out, you can see many of these nests along the beach, and, if your lucky enough, to see them hatch and try to make their way to the ocean!</p>
                    <p>Swimming with the Manatees is a popular tourist experience that takes place in the summer on the <a href="http://www.crystalriverfl.org/page/for_visitors" target="_blank">Crystal River</a> or the winter in the <a href="https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Homosassa-Springs" target="_blank">Homosassa River</a>.  Several tour operators offer these get-wet excursions 7 days a week, year-round.</p>
                    <p><a href="http://www.visitstpeteclearwater.com/article/fort-de-soto-park" target="_blank">Fort Desoto</a>, <a href="http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/managedlands/skp.htm" target="_blank">Shell Key</a>, and <a href="https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Egmont-Key" target="_blank">Egmont Key</a> are three islands located on the mouth of Tampa Bay.  Fort Desoto is the only one of the three that is reachable by car.  The most popular and interesting area of this State Park is its northernmost shoreline.  Shell Island is reachable only by boat and is a shell hunter's paradise!  Its backside is a wade-in fisherman's delight, as well.  Several tour boat companies offer water taxis/shuttles to these keys.  Egmont Key is, again, only reachable by boat and is home to to large tortoises.  Trek through the trails, keeping your eyes and ears open for them.  Egmont Key used to be a coastal artillery base.  The ruins are still seen throughout the island.  There are NO facilities on this island, so make sure you bring enough food and drink to last the trip!</p>
